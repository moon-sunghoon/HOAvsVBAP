      content: This is a listening test for the evaluation of <b>Higer Order Ambisonic </b> and <b>Vector Base Amplitude Panning </b> in the binaural headphones system. </br></br> The test consists of two main parts for different attirubtes assessment, Localization Performance and Impression on Surround Quality. </br> The detailed instruction will be given before each assessment starts. </br></br> Please use the headphones throughout the listening test </br></br> All the test information is anonymous. </br> this listening test complies with GDPR. </br>If you want to withdraw your test result, please send a email to the address <b> "s.moon3@unimail.derby.ac.uk" </b>  </br></br> When you are ready, press the 'NEXT' button to start the test

      content: This is the first part of the listening test. During this test, the localization performance of each algorithm will be evaluated. </br>In total, there are 4 different sets for VBAP and 3rd, 4th, 5th Order Ambisnoic, which are randomly ordered.</br> Prior to each set, there will be a page for volume adjustment and reference audio sample. The location of reference is the center point of spherical coordinates. You can always go back to the page to listen to the reference.</br></br> During the test, the UI graphic will be given, which allows you to indicate the cartesian coordinates where you think the sound comes from. </br> There will be two diffrent graphic UI. </br></br> 1. view from the top  2. view from the right </br></br>At the center of the each image, there will be a dummy head, so please be aware of the direction and coordinate of the sound field. </br> You can use both graphic UI to correctly indicate the position of sound perception.

During this test, impression on surroudn quality of each algorithm will be evaluated. </br> In total, there are 4 different sets for different sound sources. </br>1.Nature </br>2.Guitar </br> 3.Football Stadium </br> 4.Band Ensemble </br></br> 7 stimuli will be given for each test set . </br>You will assess the impression on surround quality for those stimuli.  </br> Definition of <b> Impression on Surround Quality </b> for this listening test is </br></br> <b> The feeling of being immersive, whether the sound is encircling you naturally and whether it gives a sense of space both vertically and horizontally </b> </br></br>You must grade them on a scale of 0 to 100, whereby better impression on surround quality would be rated higher.</br> please grade the stimuli based on the definition of impression on surround quality, instead of grading them by comparing with the reference
